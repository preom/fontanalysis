Notes
=====

* Opencv is installed separately on the system, and then linked to.
    e.g. 

    $ cd venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    $ ln -s /usr/lib/dist-packages/cv2.x86-64-gnu.so

* Add fontanalysis package to python path

* Requires pillow, which can be difficult to install since it requires 
  libz and jpeg8... Sidenote: Installation somehow magically worked after 
  restarting computer.
